            Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Kota Kemuning (previously known as Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Kemuning) started the school session on January 7, 2002. The name of the school follows its geographical location, Kota Kemuning.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="parafont2">
            The construction of this school is managed by the real estate development company HICOM-Gamuda Development Sdn. Bhd. (A joint venture between DRB-HICOM and Gamuda Land) and on November 15, 2001, ownership of the school was then handed over to the Klang District Education Department, Selangor Education Department which is under the administration of the Government under the Ministry of Education as an inauguration as a school.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="parafont2">
            Now, this school serves morning and afternoon sessions. This school is still under the Klang District Education Department even though according to its geographical position, it is under the jurisdiction of the Shah Alam City Council. The original plan of this infrastructure was to accommodate 1500 students in 44 classrooms.
